  The author Jessica Helfand, starts the passage by expressing to her readers 
                  about how a newly engaged form of any critical practice is necessary if it does
                   not include exploring one’s originality. She speaks about how autonomy in graphic 
                   design is vital to sustain a designer’s true identity.
                   <br> 
<br>
                  In the genesis of this article, Konstantin Stanislavski, a theatre practitioner, 
                  compares modern theatre by introducing  <mark>a new system of training</mark> in which the actor
                   would draw on his or her own emotions to truly understand their original character.
                    He states We protested against the old manner of acting and against theatricality,
                     against artificial pathos and declamation,” in order to bring about a revolution 
                     in the field of acting. In contrast to the loud, overdramatic fashion, a character
                      once understood could be portrayed much more subtly encompassing all his/her 
                      traits. This pedagogical system developed by Konstantin was titled ‘method 
                      training’ which was laster used to train designers.

  The writer states that although there could be fine system designed to teach design to students,
   but it may not prove to be a breeding ground for innovation. She mentions that she herself was an 
   actress before she pursued graphic design, and struggled with implementing the ‘method design’ model
    into her work. Delving more into the emotional psychology aspect, Jessica expatiates about the 
    necessity of <mark>‘emotional honesty’</mark> in design. Emotional honesty helps your audience resonate with 
    your work or performance because spectators are always looking for a one-on-one connection with 
    art. This method used in graphic design backfires paradoxically because the author states that 
    students fail to establish their own identity in the mere process of trying to create work that
     befits set design standards. The line “The persistent evidence of impenetrable personal work in
      design schools across America is a serious epidemic, resulting in a kind of method designing that
       erroneously treats sentiment as substance, and why?” stands out as it reflects how art cannot
        be weighed and calculated rather it should be felt and fathomed with all five human senses. 
        This reading served as a stimulus to keep asking difficult questions, solving harder problems,
         inventing better worlds, being true to ourselves as <mark>creators and not imposters.</mark>
